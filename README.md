# Physical Oceanography

The book/notes are readable on https://pob.readthedocs.io

This project is meant to be a collection of notes on physical oceanography.

In the beginning the project started by using notes that were taught at NYU by Dr. Shafer Smith (https://cims.nyu.edu/~shafer/papers/index.html).

The longterm motivation of the project is to build a resource (like an online book) for oceanographers to refer to when they want to. This should include a collection of notes on theory, worked out examples, observational analysis, references to suitable papers etc. 

One of the goals is to have this document be self contained for introductory material, but at the same time link the reader to current state of research.
