How to write
============

This is a simple primer on how to write in this book... 

We will be using something called reST - reStructuredText 
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html

Similar to LATEX there are syntax for everything, and then it autoformats.

You can online tools like : http://socrates.io/ to write up your rst files and make sure they look correct in real time.


Since we are interested in writing math often. 

We can write an equation by just writing,
   ``.. math::``
   ``2 + 2 = 5``
which becomes,

.. math::
   2 + 2 = 5 \sigma
   
or somethimes if we want to write inline equation, we use ``:math:`\frac{3}{4}`` to write :math:`\frac{3}{4}`.
