Physical Oceanography
======================================================

This is a collection of notes on physical oceanography that are meant to be editted by its readers, and develop into a resource for the community. 

We imagine this to be a collection of notes that can be used for self-study or helpful in classroom teaching. 

Why these notes when numerous books are available? 
  We imagine the answer to this being the same as why wikipedia, when encyclopedias were being printed? 
  
  We think that there are a lot of great books on oceanography and dynamics, each having its strengths and weaknesses. Hopefully this forum would bring the strengths from all the books together in one place. 
  Also being present as a webresource we could add in interactive examples, which the readers could interact with and learn by doing.
  
For now please feel free to contribute by helping type up equations (hand written notes can be upladed as images too), write concrete physical explanations, and generate notebooks with examples.
